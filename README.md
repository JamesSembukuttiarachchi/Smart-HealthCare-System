## Project Overview

The Smart Healthcare System is designed to enhance the efficiency of healthcare services in urban hospitals across Sri Lanka by digitizing patient records and appointment scheduling. The aim is to streamline healthcare delivery in both private and public hospitals through a unified digital platform. The system leverages digital health cards to facilitate quick and easy access to patient information, reducing delays and operational costs in hospital management.
This system will empower patients to manage their healthcare needs online, view their medical records, track treatment history, and make appointments through a web or mobile interface. It will also enable healthcare professionals to better manage patient data and optimize hospital operations.
